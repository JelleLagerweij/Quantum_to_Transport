## Quantum_to_Transport
This project analyzed the Grotthuss transfer (proton hopping) of $OH^-$ in KOH (aq). The listed python codes performed different tasks: (1) postprocessing AIMD and MLMD simulations from VASP 6.4.2 output files; (2) postprocessing classical MD files; and (3) read out the postprocessed data and creating datafiles and figures for the publication.


### AIMD/MLMD
The code Prot_Hop_mpi.py is a python code 
### Classical MD 
## Modeling Transport Properties of Aqueous Potassium Hydroxide by Machine Learning Molecular Force Fields from Quentum Mechanics
