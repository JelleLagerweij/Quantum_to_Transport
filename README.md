# Quantum_to_Transport
## Modeling Transport Properties of Aqueous Potassium Hydroxide by Machine Learning Molecular Force Fields from Quentum Mechanics

In this repository all relavant simulation settings, input files, execute commands and post-prosessing scrips for the master thesis with the same title are availlable.
All simulations are performed with VASP 6.4.1, compiled with gcc 11. Modules loaded contain openmpi, openblas, netlib-scalapack, fftw and hdf5.


## Pure water
In the subdirectory with this name, the simulation settings and input files of a system of 64 waters molecule is availlable.


## Post-Prosessing contains the post-prossesing scripts of the pure water, the KOH validation and the KOH production simulations
